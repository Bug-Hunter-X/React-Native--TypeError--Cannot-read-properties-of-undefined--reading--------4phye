This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens when a component renders before the asynchronous operation that sets the state has completed. For example, if you fetch data in `componentDidMount` and try to render that data immediately, you might encounter this.  Another common scenario is with deeply nested components where state propagation is delayed.
